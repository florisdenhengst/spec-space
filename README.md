In *Inigo Romeo et al.*, We propose a measure and a metric on the sets of infinite traces generated by a set of atomic propositions. To compute these quantities, we first map properties to subsets of the real numbers and then take the Lebesgue measure of the resulting sets. We analyze how this measure is computed for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. Here you find our implementation for computing the measure of *bounded* LTL properties. This implementation leverages SAT model counting (see [sharpSAT](https://github.com/marcthurley/sharpSAT)) and effects independence checks on subexpressions to compute the measure and metric compositionally.
